StarlightCTF is a repository containing **notes** pointing to ideas and resources. It's purpose is to help the user (usually me) to find solutions to **security-related challenges** and provide some tools to use when offline.

The resources that I use most often are marked with a heart :heart: symbol.

This database was inspired by [CTF Katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana) (unmaintained) and [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) (pentest-oriented). It usually contains a **brief description** of the idea/tool and **pointers** to more in-depth content.

Most of the tools here are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and are designed to be used in a [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) (or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) environment.
