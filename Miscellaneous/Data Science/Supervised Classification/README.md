#### Models

* `Logistic Regression`

    High explainability, reasonable computation cost.

* `Decision Tree`

    Performs classification, regression, and multi-output tasks. Good at finding **orthogonal** decision boundaries.

    But very sensitive to small changes in the data, which make them hard to train.


* `Random Forest`

    Very powerful model. Uses an ensemble method to combine multiple decision trees. 


* `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`

    Popular model that performs linear and non-linear classification, regression, and outlier detection.

    Works well with **small to medium** sized datasets.


* `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`


* `Naive Bayes`

* `Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)`

    A neural network model that can learn non-linear decision boundaries.

    Good for **large** datasets.
