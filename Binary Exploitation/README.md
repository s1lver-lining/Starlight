Different types of exploit exists, the most common are:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Format String](../Tools/ELF/6-format_string_vulns/) | Exploits format string functions to read and write in the program memory |
| [Overwriting stack variables](../Tools/ELF/1-overwriting_stack_variables/) | Change the value of a variable on the stack. |
| [ret2win](../Tools/ELF/3-ret2win_with_params/) | Overwrite the return address to point to an interesting function of the program |
| [Shellcode](../Tools/ELF/4-injecting_custom_shellcode/) | Inject shellcode in the program memory and execute it |
| [ret2libc](../Tools/ELF/5-return_to_libc/) | Overwrite the return address to point to an interesting function in libc |
| [Overwriting GOT](../Tools/ELF/8-overwriting_got/) | Overwrite the address of a function in the GOT to point to an interesting function |

But some security mechanisms exists and can be bypassed:

- ASLR<br>
    Randomization of the memory addresses of the program and the libraries.
    Solution: Leak an address and calculate the offset between the leaked address and the address of the function you want to call.

- NX<br>
    No execution of the stack.

- Stack canaries<br>
    A random value is stored on the stack and checked before returning from a function.
    Solution: [Leak the canary](../Tools/ELF/9-bypassing_canaries/) and overwrite it with the correct value.

- PIE<br>
    Randomization of the memory addresses of the program.
    Solution: [Leak an address](../Tools/ELF/7-leak_pie_ret2libc/)

Tools that will help you to exploit a binary:

* `gdb` - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger)

    Most popular debugger for **dynamic** analysis.
    See [Reverse Engineering](../Reverse%20Engineering/README.md) for more info.

* `Ghidra` - [Website](https://ghidra-sre.org/)

	Decompiler for binary files, useful for **static** analysis.
	See [Reverse Engineering](../Reverse%20Engineering/README.md) for more info.

* `---x--x--x root root`

    To exfiltrate or read a binary when you only have **execution rights**, you can load it with a library and use the library to read it.

    This needs that the binary is **dynamically linked**, and is easier if you know the name of the function you want to extract.

    Code for this library is provided [here](./Tools/exec_only_dumper).
