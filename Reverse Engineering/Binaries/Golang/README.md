[GO](https://go.dev) is a compiled programming language developed by google as a high level alternative to C. It is statically typed and compiled to machine code.

Function are named after the library they are from. For example, function from the standard I/O library are `fmt.<function>`. The main function is called `main.main`.

When the binary is stripped, the function's information is stored in the `.gopclntab` section.
