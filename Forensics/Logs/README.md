Looking at logs takes time but can lead to valuable information.

## Windows

* `Windows Event Logs` - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Viewer)

    Windows logs a *lot* of information. It can be read using `mmc.exe`, under "Windows Logs".

    The categories are:
    | Category | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Application | Programs (started, stopped ...) |
    | Security | Security events (login, logout, ...) |
    | System | Changes to system (boot, shutdown, peripherals ...) |
    | Setup | System maintenance (update logs, ...) |

## Linux

* `Linux logs` - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog)

    Linux logs are stored in `/var/log/`. The most important ones are:
    | File | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `auth.log` or `secure` | Authentication events (login, logout, ...) |
    | `syslog` or `messages` | General messages (system wide) |
    | `dpkg.log` | Package management |
    | `kern.log` | Kernel messages |
    | `btmp` | Failed login attempts |
    | `wtmp` | Login/logout history |
    | `lastlog` | Last login for each user |

    `btmp`, `wtmp` and `lastlog` can be read using `last <file>`

    Other applications can have their own logs in /var/logs.

## Apache

* `Apache logs` - [Website](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html)
  
    Apache logs are often stored in `/var/log/apache2/`. The most important ones are:
    | File | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `access.log` | HTTP requests |
    | `error.log` | HTTP errors |
    | `other_vhosts_access.log` | HTTP requests from other virtual hosts |

    `access.log` can be read using `tail -f <file>` or with `grep` to filter the logs.

    It can also be imported into a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) using this snippet:
    ```python
    # Read access.log file
    df = pd.read_csv(filename,
                sep=r'\s(?=(?:[^"]*"[^"]*")*[^"]*$)(?![^\[]*\])',
                engine='python',
                usecols=[0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
                names=['ip', 'datetime', 'request', 'status', 'size', 'referer', 'user_agent'],
                na_values='-',
                header=None
                    )

    # Extract the date from the datetime column
    df['date'] = df['datetime'].str.extract(r'\[(.*?):', expand=True)

    # Extract the time from the datetime column
    df['time'] = df['datetime'].str.extract(r':(.*?)\s', expand=True)
    ```
